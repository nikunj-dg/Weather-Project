# Weather-Project

This project automates the process of collecting daily weather data from a free open-source service and logging the daily temperature into a historical report.

The script extracts:

- Current observed temperature
- Forecasted temperature for tomorrow at noon
- Date and time information

The system:

- Downloads weather data for Casablanca
- Extracts temperature values
- Captures timestamp information
- Appends results to a structured log file
- Runs automatically using cron jobs

The pdf file has instructions to code for practice 

The doc file has the answers
